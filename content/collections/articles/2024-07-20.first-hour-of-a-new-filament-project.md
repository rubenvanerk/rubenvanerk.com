So you've just read through [First hour of a new Laravel project](https://alies.dev/articles/laravel-first-hour-setup/), and you have decided to install Filament as an admin panel. Here are the steps I would take to configure a new Filament admin panel.

### Unsaved changes alerts
When you have resources with long forms, it can be very painful to lose filled in data after accidentally closing a tab. After enabling this setting, Filament will ask the user for confirmation when they close a form that has changes.
```php
// AppPanelProvider.php

 public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
    {
        return $panel
        	...
        	->unsavedChangesAlerts(); // [tl! highlight]
    }
)
```


### Allow password resets
By default, you can't reset your own password in a Filament admin panel. To give your users some autonomy, you can enable this feature.
```php
// AppPanelProvider.php

 public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
    {
        return $panel
        	...
        	->passwordReset(); // [tl! highlight]
    }
)
```

### Enabling profile
In a similar vein, you can enable the user profile, so users can change their own email and password.
```php
// AppPanelProvider.php

 public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
    {
        return $panel
        	...
        	->profile(); // [tl! highlight]
    }
)
```

### Top navigation
When you're starting out on a new project, you probably won't have that many menu items yet. You may want to enable top navigation to reclaim some horizontal space.
```php
// AppPanelProvider.php

 public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
    {
        return $panel
        	...
        	->topNavigation(); // [tl! highlight]
    }
)
```

### Notifications
Most admin panels will send some form of notifications to their admins. By default, Filament will use Livewire's [polling feature](https://livewire.laravel.com/docs/wire-poll) to check for new notifications. If you need real-time notifications, check out the docs to set up a [websocket](https://filamentphp.com/docs/3.x/panels/notifications#setting-up-websockets-in-a-panel).
```php
// AppPanelProvider.php

 public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
    {
        return $panel
        	...
            ->databaseNotifications() // [tl! highlight]
            ->databaseNotificationsPolling('30s'); // [tl! highlight]
    }
)
```

### Pagination
At some point, you probably will have a lot of rows in a Filament table, and at some point someone will attempt to show all records and they will complain that it won't work. With the option to show 100 records, I personally don't feel the need to show all and that's why I like to disable that option in all my tables:
```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

// You can place this in any service provider
 public function boot()
{
    Table::configureUsing(fn (Table $table) => $table->paginationPageOptions([10, 25, 50, 100])); // [tl! highlight]
}

```

If there's a Resource you'd like to override this for, you can use the `->paginated()` method on the `$table`:
```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;
 
public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->paginated([10, 25, 50, 100, 'all']); // [tl! highlight]
}
```

Well, this probably took you less than an hour to configure. Good luck with your new Filament admin panel!
